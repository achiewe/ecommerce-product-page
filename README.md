### What I learned

This project has been a new and challenging experience for me. i learned how to display multiple images of sneakers with corresponding thumbnails and enable users to view larger versions through an overlay. implementing image navigation using previous and next arrows was another important aspect. i also develope the art of updating the selected image and its thumbnail based on user interaction. finally, i successfully implemented responsive design for different screen sizes. this project pushed me to learn and overcome new difficulty in web development.
